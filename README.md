# Rust Project-Based Learning Application
![Rust](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f2412bf-9ff9-4656-b64c-4f99521c59a8)


This repository represents various Modular Projects based on Rust Programming Language. The goal is to learn various programming concepts of Rust through building Projects. The idea is inspired from @JohnCrickett Challenge. 

# WHY \ What \ How 

### Progressive Learning Path
By creating a repository of modular projects, one can learn in start with simple concepts and gradually build up to more complex Rust features and patterns. This approach allows anyone to learn at their own pace and revisit earlier projects as understanding grows.
### Hands-on Experience
Building actual projects provides practical, hands-on experience with Rust. This method of learning by doing helps reinforce concepts more effectively than passive learning alone. One will encounter real-world challenges and learn how to apply Rust's features to solve them.

### Modular Approach Benefits
Breaking down learning into modular projects offers several advantages:

- Focus on specific concepts or features in each project
- Easier to manage and understand smaller, self-contained codebases
- Flexibility to explore different areas of Rust (e.g., systems programming, web development, game development)
- Ability to combine modules later for more complex applications

### Portfolio Development
As one build their repository, one can simultaneously create a portfolio of Rust projects. This can be valuable when:

- Seeking Rust-related job opportunities
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Demonstrating your skills to the Rust community

### Community Engagement
A public repository of Rust projects can:

- Attract feedback and contributions from other Rust enthusiasts
- Serve as a resource for other learners
- Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing within the Rust ecosystem

By building a repository of modular Rust projects, you create a personalized, practical, and engaging learning experience that not only enhances your skills but also contributes to your professional development and community involvement.Last edited just now

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install both by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdabir1203/InventRust.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

To run the application, execute: ``` cargo build --release ```

## Usage

Various Projects have various usecases. The github readme in each folder will give you what the project is about. Also check Medium Articles and Podcast on the Repo
